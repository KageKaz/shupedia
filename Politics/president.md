each president has certain policies that he campaigns on, forming an informal contract with his electors. This forms his [[policy agenda]].
# Formal Powers 
Explicitly given in article II of the [[US Constitution]].
* [[veto]]
	* president has 10 days to sign a bill once he gets it. If the president doesn't sign the bill and the[[US Congress]]  adjourns, it's [[pocket veto|pocket vetoed]]. 
	* often just threatening [[veto]] is enough to change a bill.
* commander-in-chief
* appointment
	* often contentious with [[Senate]]
	* ambassadors
	* white house staff - no approval necessary by [[Senate]].
	* cabinet 
	* federal courts
# Informal Powers
* persuasion - persuade people to pressure representatives. When the president speaks, people listen.
	* Perhaps the president's most unique power is the attention of the entire nation, even the entire world.
	* [[State of the Union Address]]
	* [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]  - fireside chats.
	* Debate between [[Richard Nixon]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] didn't look as good as [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]. 
		* Radio listeners thought [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]  won.
		* TV views thought [[John F. Kennedy|JFK]] won.
	* Social Media - quick, direct communication with the American people.
		* [[Donald Trump|Trump]] created over 26,000 tweets in the first year of his presidency. 35 tweets per day on his last year. Eventually banned.
* bargaining - bargain with [[US Congress]].  The higher the approval rating, the more effective this is because [[US Congress|congress]]  feels a need to listen to the president.
* [[executive order]]
* [[signing statement]] 
* [[executive agreement]]

# Expression of executive power
Two overarching views:
+ do everything for the people as long as it's not forbidden by the [[US Constitution]].
+ do nothing except what is explicitly granted in the [[US Constitution]].

* [[Abraham Lincoln]] - assumed executive power to save the union and suspended [[Habeas Corpus]].
* [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] - used executive power to pass [[New Deal]] legislation. [[veto|Vetoed]] over 300 times as many bills as [[George Washington|Washington]]. Elected 4 times, tried to push out [[Supreme Court]] judges that opposed him.
