Because members in the [[Senate]] have the power to speak as long as they want, unless 60 senators vote for [[cloture]], senators use never-ending debate to block a bill from even being voted on, thus, "leaving no fingerprints".

Longest [[filibuster]] was over 24 hours. This kind of filibuster docent really happen anymore, because legislators can simply threaten a [[filibuster]] for the same result.

An argument against this would be that it is undemocratic.
However, the advantage of the 60-vote rule is that it prevents minority rights and forces compromise. Otherwise, the majority party would just pass whatever they wanted and then it would all get overturned once the minority party gained a majority.

In 2013, the [[Democratic party]] controlled [[Senate]] ended the filibuster for all nominees except [[Supreme Court]] nominees. A [[Republican party]] controlled [[Senate]] ended it for [[Supreme Court]] nominees as well in 2017.
