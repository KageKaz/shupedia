# Electrical Potential Energy
### In a field
In an electrical field, electrical potential energy is equal to the charge of the particle times the voltage.
This is because
$$
W=F\cdot D
$$
$$
\Delta PE=F\cdot D
$$
$$
\Delta PE=qED
$$
E=field
$$
\Delta PE=q\left( \frac{V}{D} \right)D
$$
$$
\Delta PE=qV
$$
