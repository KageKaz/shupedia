> [!info] A magnetic field is a picture that we use to describe how the [[magnetic force]] is distributed in the space around and within something magnetic.

Magnetic fields occur when charges are in motion. The more charges in motion, the stronger that magnetic field.
+ Thus field is directly proportional to the current, or the amount of charges in motion. 
+ The field is weaker the further it is away from the wire. This is described by [[Ampere's law]]

The magnetic field is described mathematically as a [[vector field]]. Imagine a grid of compasses. Each represents a vector. The magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the [[magnetic force]].

Thus, to measure/define a magnetic field, we need its strength and direction.
+ For direction, we can use a compass. For conventional current flowing through a straight wire this can be found with the right-hand-rule.  This rule is derived from the [[cross product]].![[Pasted image 20240212112939.png]]

+ Measuring strength is much harder. We can use a [[magnetometer]].

The magnetic field can also be represented with field lines.
* Magnetic field lines never cross
* The [[density]] of field lines represents the strength of the [[magnetic force]] because field lines naturally bunch together where [[magnetic force]] is the strongest.

The units for magnetic field are tesla ($T$), which represent how much force is applied to a moving charge from the field. Another unit is the Gauss ($G$). $1T=10^4G$

The magnitude of the magnetic field is $B$. Magnetic field strength is $H$, and this is similar to $B$ but takes into account the effect of fields being concentrated by magnetic materials.
