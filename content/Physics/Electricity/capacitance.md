> [!info] Capacitance is equal to the charge of one side of the [[capacitor]] divided by the voltage difference across the [[capacitor]].
  
Large capacitance -> can store large charge
Small capacitance -> can store small charge

The units for capacitance are Faraday, or coulomb-volts.

Capacitance is a material property, so the only way to change the capacitance of a [[capacitor]] is to change the [[material]], size, or distance between the plates.
