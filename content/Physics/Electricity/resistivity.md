[[resistivity]] is a measure of the [[resistance]] of a [[material]].
[[metals]] have lower [[resistivity]], while [[non-metals]] offer greater [[resistivity]] .
[[resistivity]] is inversely proportional to [[conductivity]]. $\rho=\dfrac{1}{\sigma}$
The units of [[resistivity]] are $\Omega\cdot m$, because $m^2$ from the area is divided by $m$ from the length when you solve for [[resistivity]].
