> [!definition] Enthalpy is defined as $H=E+pV$, or equal to internal [[energy]] plus pressure times volume.

It's not very easy to measure, but we can think about the change in [[enthalpy]], or $\Delta H$.
The [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be rewritten as $\Delta U=q_{p}-p\Delta V$ because at constant pressure $W=-p\Delta V$
$$
U_{F}-U_{I}=q_{p}-p(V_{F}-V_{i})
$$
regroup
$$
q_{p}=(U_{F}+pV_{F})-(U_{I}+pV_{I})
$$
$$
q_{p}=H_{F}-H_{I}=\Delta H
$$
>[!definition] At constant [[pressure]] change in [[enthalpy]] is equal to the change in internal [[energy]].

The sign of $\Delta H$ tells us if a process is [[endothermic]] or [[exothermic]].
