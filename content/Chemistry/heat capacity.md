> [!definition] The [[heat capacity]] of an object is the amount of heat necessary to raise the [[temperature]] of an object by one degree (c).

specific [[heat capacity]], $C_{s}$ refers to the [[energy]] to raise one gram.
[[mole|molar]] [[heat capacity]], $C_{m}$ refers to the [[energy]] to raise one [[mole]]

$$
C_{s}=\frac{q}{m\Delta T}
$$
> [!example] The [[heat capacity|specific heat]] of water is 4.18. It takes 4.18 Joules of [[energy]] to increase one gram of water by one degree celesius.
