for $aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD$
$$K_{c}=\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$
using [[equilibrium]] concentrations. The [[reaction quotient]] uses concentrations not at [[equilibrium]].
We use $K_{C}$ with concentrations, and $K_{P}$ with partial [[pressure]].

> [!question] Why raise to the power of the coefficient?
We are essentially dividing how many products we have by how many reactants. For example, for equation $A+A\rightleftharpoons C$,
$$K_{c}=\frac{[A][A]}{[C]}$$

To calculate the equilibrium constant, you can take the initial proportion of reactants and products, figure out how much one changes, and then figure how much all of them change based on mole ratio. This can be done in an ICE table.

A large _K_ value (greater than 1) indicates that there are more products than reactants at equilibrium, while a small _K_ value indicates that there are more reactants than products at equilibrium.

### Properties
Reversing a reaction just reciprocates the equilibrium constant because you are switching the numerator and denominator. 
Multiplying by a constant raises the equilibrium constant to that power, because that the coefficients become the exponents in the formula.
If one reaction is the sum of two other reactions, the equilibrium constant for that reaction is the product of the other two. This because adding a reactant or product to a reaction multiplies it in the equilibrium constant expression.
## [[solubility]] equilibria
When dealing with dissolved ions, use $K_{sp}$ (solubility product) and ignore solids. 
Usually this takes the form of
$$
AB_{s}\leftrightharpoons A_{aq}+B_{aq} 
$$
If $K_{sp}>1$, it is [[solubility|soluble]].
If $K_{sp}<1$, it is not very [[solubility|soluble]].
