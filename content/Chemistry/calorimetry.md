In a [[calorimetry|calorimeter]], the heat lost by one thing is gained by the other. 

# Constant [[pressure]] 
if [[pressure]] is constant (open container), $q=-q$. We can measure q, and use it to calculate [[heat capacity|specific heat]] if one of the substances is known. Using [[heat capacity|specific heat]], we can identify the other substance.

# Constant [[volume]]
In a bomb calorimeter, [[volume]] is constant, there is no work done, meaning $q_{V}=\Delta E$.
