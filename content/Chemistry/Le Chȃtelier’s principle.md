When we create a stress on a reaction, it will try to relieve it.
# Concentration
If we increase concentration of reactants (at constant [[temperature]]), the excess of reactants will create a bunch of products until [[equilibrium]].
If we increase concentration of products, the opposite will happen.
# [[volume]]
If we decrease volume (at constant [[temperature]]), we increase pressure. Thus, the reaction is going to try to decrease pressure until it reaches [[equilibrium]] again, and it does that by favoring the reaction that produces fewer coefficients.
# [[Temperature]] 
 If the temperature of the system is increased (at constant _V_), the system will shift in the direction that consumes the excess heat. The [[equilibrium constant]] changes because essentially an outside force ([[energy]]) has pushed the reaction one way.
