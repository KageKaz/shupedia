If $Q<K$, we have fewer products than we would at [[equilibrium]]. Thus, the forward reaction is favored and the excess of reactants will turn into products. 

If $Q>K$, we have more products than we would at [[equilibrium]]. Thus, the reverse reaction is favored and the excess of products will turn into reactants. 

[[Le Chȃtelier’s principle]] is behind this.
