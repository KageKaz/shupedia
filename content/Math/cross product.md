> [!info] $\vec{a}\times \vec{b}=\mid \vec{a}\mid\mid \vec{b}\mid \sin \theta\cdot \hat{n}$

$\hat{n}$ is perpendicular to both $\vec{a}$ and $\hat{b}$
$\mid \vec{a}\mid\cdot \sin \theta$ is the component of $\vec{a}$ that is perpendicular to $\vec{b}$. Essentially you are finding how far apart these two [[vector|vectors]] are, and pointing it in a third direction.
To figure out its direction, ![[Pasted image 20240214110114.png|500]]
your pointer finger is $\vec{a}$, your middle finger is $\vec{b}$. Your thumb represents the direction of $\hat{n}$.
