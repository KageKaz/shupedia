intuition: if r is 1, then your slope is just equal to the ratio of [[standard deviation|standard deviations]], the [[mean|average]] change in y over the [[mean|average]] change in x. if r is zero, your slope is zero. if r is a little less, then your slope is a little less than the exact ratio of [[standard deviation|standard deviations]].
