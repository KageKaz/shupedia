the central limit theorem states that if you take samples of any [[probability distribution]] with a defined [[mean]] and [[variance]], the [[sampling distribution]] of the [[mean]] of those samples will approach a [[normal distribution]] as your sample size (how many samples you are averaging) approaches [[infinity]]. 

By convention, if the sample size is equal or greater than 30, the [[central limit theorem]]  applies. If the [[probability distribution]] is already [[normal distribution|normal]], then even if we don't have a sample size greater than 30, we can conclude that the distribution of the sample [[mean]] is [[normal distribution|normal]].

>[!example] ![](https://i.imgur.com/9yDWjxA.png)For example, in this case the sample size is 4. 

> [!question] Does this work for any [[statistic]] or just the [[mean]]? It seems like it probably does work for other [[statistic|statistics]] but there may be some edge cases.
