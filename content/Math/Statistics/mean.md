The mean is a balancing point. The total distance from points above the mean is equal to the total distance of points below the mean. 
Mean is bad at estimating the center of skewed [[distribution]] because it is pulled by the long tail.
## population mean
$$
\mu=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nx_{i}}{N}
$$
## sample mean
$$
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_{i}}{n}
$$
