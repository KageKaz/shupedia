The [[US Congress]] forms the [[Legislative Branch]] of the US Government. They have the sole power to make laws.
[[Bicameral Legislature]] - power is divided between two houses, the [[Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives]].

Article 1, Section 8 of the [[US Constitution]] states the [[enumerated powers]] of the [[US Congress]]. It also contains the [[necessary and proper clause]].

Out of necessity, both branches of the [[US Congress]] have [[committee|committees]]. 

[[ideological division]] plays in important role in how well [[US Congress|congress]] functions. 
	Compromise becomes difficult, resulting in policy [[gridlock]].	
	The best way for a party to get its legislation passed is to have a majority in both houses.
		This is how [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] got his [[New Deal]] passed and [[Obama]] got his healthcare plan passed.
	A [[divided government]] slows things down significantly.
### How does a bill become a law?
A bill can be sponsored by a member from either the [[House of Representatives]] or the [[Senate]].
As a bill is debated, it is changed.
	This is usually in the form of [[non-germane riders]] and [[pork barrel]].
Once a bill is assigned to a [[committee]], it can be further debated and changed.
Once it comes out of the [[committee]], it goes to the floor for a vote.
If a bill passes in both houses, it goes to the [[president]] for signing.
	Bill voting is effected by [[log rolling]]
