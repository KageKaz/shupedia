The confidence level is a percentage that tells you that if you create many [[confidence interval|confidence intervals]], the confidence level percent of them will have the true [[parameter]].
> [!warning] The confidence level does not tell you the percentage that a specific [[confidence interval]] has the true [[parameter]]. This is because the [[confidence interval]] either has the [[parameter]] or it doesn't, both are fixed.

> [!example] If we are give confidence level, we can find sample size necessary to achieve it by assuming the [[margin of error]] is as big as it possibly can be and solving for sample size.
