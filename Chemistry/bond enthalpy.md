> [!definition] [[bond enthalpy]] is $\Delta H$ for breaking one [[bond]] 

[[bond enthalpy]] is positive when [[bond|bonds]] are broken because it takes [[energy]] to break [[bond|bonds]]. 
[[bond enthalpy]] is negative when [[bond|bonds]] are formed because [[energy]] is released.
Thus, [[bond enthalpy]] of a reaction is equal to **[[bond|bonds]] broken - [[bond|bonds]] formed**.

Stronger [[bond|bonds]] have higher [[bond enthalpy|bond enthalpies]].
