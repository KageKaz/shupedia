An [[endothermic]] process has a a positive $\Delta H$. It gains [[energy]] from the surroundings. 
> [!example] melting an ice cube - the ice cube gains heat from the surroundings and the surroundings lose heat [[energy]]. If a reaction occurs and the beaker is cold, that means that the [[system]] took [[energy]] from the surroundings, making it [[exothermic]].
