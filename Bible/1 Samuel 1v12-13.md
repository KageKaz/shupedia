> [!bible]+ [1 Samuel 1:12-13 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/9/1/) [[1 Samuel]]
>  <sup> 12 </sup>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <sup> 13 </sup>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.

Prior to this section, Hannah makes a promise to [[God]], that if she gets a child she will dedicate him to [[God]]. In times of peril, we often make these sorts of promises. If you save me, I'll do whatever you want.
But should we make these vows? I think what's really important here is not what Hannah says, or the vow she makes. By making a vow, she doesn't magically twist [[God]]'s arm into doing what she wants. It's the heart. And she does follow through on her vow, showing her heart.
