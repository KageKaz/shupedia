[[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] presents a hardline choice between the life of the ethical and the aesthetic. 
* If you try to split the difference, you are living an aesthetic life because you can't not having the pleasure of having both.  

**Aesthetic life** -  living for physical and intellectual pleasure. 
* It is our default orientation, just look around you!
	* Mirrors the idea of [[original sin]]
* [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] thinks these people are oblivious, distracting themselves from seeing things as they really are. The misery in this life is boredom. 
	> Boredom is the root of all evil
* [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] argues that if people realized the sheer meaninglessness of the aesthetic life, switching from one amusement to another, they would commit suicide. 

**Ethical life** - pursuing moral laws FROM [[God]] for their own sake
* If it is not from [[God]], we are merely using [[ethics]] to pat ourselves on the back.
