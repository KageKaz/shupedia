# Christian [[existentialism]]
One has to to choose between a life of [[faith]] and [[reason]]. They are mutually excusive. 
But how do we choose? It's circular. The one who believes in [[reason]] uses it to argue for it. The one who believes in [[faith]] trusts it on the basis of [[faith]].  We have a[[ criterionless choice]]. 
+ Make a decision.
+ You have no standards upon which to make the decision.
+ It's the most important choice in your life.
+ But you have to make the decision.

Individual human beings, in the time and place that they live, must make a decision between the ethical life and the aesthetic life.  This decision illustrated in his book, [[EitherOr]].

[[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] is a very tortured man. He feels that people who haven't suffered for their beliefs don't deserve them, like you earn your stripes by thinking and *feeling* problems through. This idea is [[theological romanticism]]. His book [[Fear and Trembling]] expresses this sentiment.
