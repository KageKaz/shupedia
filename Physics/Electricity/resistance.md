### [[resistance]]  is how much [[current]] is impeded. 
$I=\dfrac{V}{R}$
Unit - $\Omega$

### $Resistance=Resistivity \cdot\frac{Length}{Cross sectional Area}$
The longer the resistor, the longer the [[current]] has to travel through it.
The larger the area, the more room the [[current]] has to flow through it.
The [[resistance]] also depends on the [[resistivity]] of the material. 

> [!question] Why does a [[resistance|resistor]] get hot when [[current]] passes through it?
[[voltage]] drops across a [[resistance|resistor]]. That means that [[electric potential]] decreases. Thus, electric [[potential energy]] must decrease. So where does all that [[energy]] go? Current is constant across the [[resistance|resistor]], so it isn't converted to [[kinetic energy]]. Instead, as the electrons flow through the [[resistance|resistor]], they bump into the [[resistance|resistor]] , transferring heat as [[energy]].

> [!question] So how can we figure out how much heat it gains? 
> In this case, [[power]] is equal to the change in electrical [[potential energy]] over time. 
> $EPE=charge*voltage$
