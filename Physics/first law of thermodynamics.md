$$
\Delta E=q+w
$$
The change in [[energy]] of a [[system]] is equal to the heat [[energy]] inputted (q) plus the [[work]] done (w) on the [[system]].

# Signs
q is positive when heat flows into the [[system]]. q is negative when heat flows out of the [[system]].
w is positive when [[work]] is done on the [[system]] by the surroundings. w is negative when the [[system]] does [[work]].
